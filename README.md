## R Assignments: Exploring Data and Building Models (Master's Degree)

This document showcases a collection of R assignments completed during my Master's program, highlighting various data exploration and modeling techniques:

**1. Financial Data Exploration:**

- Investigated correlations between sales, profits, and assets of large companies.
- Visualized data to identify potential areas for improvement.

**2. Wage and Education Data Analysis:**

- Analyzed the normality of income and education data in Pima Indians and Wage datasets.
- Employed QQ plots, boxplots, histograms, and Mardia's, Royston's, and Henze-Zirkler's tests.

**3. mtcars Feature Exploration:**

- Analyzed the mtcars dataset to understand factors influencing fuel efficiency (mpg).
- Used multiple linear regression to identify relationships between mpg and other car features.

**4. Chocolate Ratings: ANOVA & MANOVA:**

- Employed ANOVA to assess the impact of "Company" on chocolate "Rating".
- Utilized MANOVA to examine the combined effect of "mfr" and "type" on nutritional features.

**5. LDA & QDA for Classification:**

- Performed Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) to classify cars by cylinder count using mtcars data.
- Implemented Quadratic Discriminant Analysis (QDA) to classify Iris flowers based on sepal/petal dimensions.

**6. PCA on US Judge Ratings (Dim Reduction & Interpretation):**

- Used Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to analyze judge ratings and identify underlying patterns.
- Reduced data dimensionality while retaining key information for more concise interpretation.

**7. Swiss Canton Fertility: Regression Analysis:**

- Investigated Swiss canton fertility rates using multiple linear regression models.
- Identified the best model to predict fertility based on socio-economic factors.
- Evaluated model assumptions and prediction accuracy on unseen data.

**8. Carseats Sales Analysis:**

- Analyzed car seat sales using multiple regression with both full and reduced models.
- Evaluated the impact of price, urban location, and US location on sales.
- Calculated confidence intervals for the final model.

**9. Stock Market Direction Prediction:**

- Used Logistic Regression to predict future stock market up/down movements based on historical data.
- Evaluated the model's performance on training and testing datasets.

**10. Linear Regression with ANOVA: Fiber and Calories in Cereals:**

- Investigated the relationship between fiber content and cereal calories using linear regression and ANOVA.
- Manually calculated ANOVA statistics and verified results with built-in functions.
- Explored the F-distribution curve to understand the p-value's context.

This collection demonstrates a strong understanding of various R techniques for data exploration, analysis, and model building.
